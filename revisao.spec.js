//Important concepts:

//Software Testing:
//It's the process of running a software in order to observe its behavior with respect to necessary requirements, or running a program to intentionally "cause" errors.


//Software Testing Steps:

//Planning:
//-Designing a mind map to organize the requirements (business rules)
//-Strategies
//-Testing techniques (functional, structural, and mutation)
//-Criteria
//-Features to be tested
//-Associated risks
//-Schedule

//Test case design:
//-Ordered pair - input and expected output
//-Creating test cases (regressive, positive, negative, functional)
//-Writing scenarios in Gherkin (syntax to illustrate ideas by describing a behavior (Given/When/Then))
//-Input data and actions for executing the tests
//-Steps for executing the test cases

//Software execution:
//-Run the test cases previously created
//-Chronological details
//-If there is any problem in the execution, report what happened in a document.

//Results Analysis:
//-Software behavior
//-Quality Indicators (data, charts, reports)


//Levels of Software Testing:
//-Unit testing
//-Integration testing
//-System testing


//Difference between error, defect, fault, and failure:

//Error = a human action that produces an incorrect result;
//Defect = an incorrect step, process, or data definition in a software product;
//Fault = difference between the calculated (or experimental) value and the theoretical value;
//Failure = the inability of the system or component to perform the required function.

//In summary:
//An error introduces a defect into the software. When activated, the defect may create a fault. If propagated to the software output, the fault causes a failure.
